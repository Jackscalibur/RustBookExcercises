# Rust Book Exercises

## Introduction

This repository includes the exercises that you will find while reading through the Rust book, or as it's otherwise called, "the book."

It's an easy way to reference the final code examples of what you might see while reading through this book. My solutions might be tweaked a little bit as well.

## Installation

If you want to work with my examples, you can run the following command in the directory of your choosing:

```
git clone https://github.com/Jackscalibur/RustBookExcercises.git
